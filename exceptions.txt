java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero
java.util.InputMismatchException
java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException


Errors:
->Compile Time Errors
	->are detected at compile time
	->are syntaxical errors
	->if our code has CTE, we cannot run the code
	
->Run Time Errors / Exceptions
	->are detected at run time
	->are logical errors / system flaws
	->if our code has Exceptions, we can still run the code
	->at run time, when an exception is detected, the code crashes.
	->crash: untimely application exit.

Exception Handling:
->here, we detect run time errors in our code and prevent crashes.

->in java, we have 100s of built in exceptions
->all predefined exceptions are predefined classes.
->most of the predefined exceptions are located in the package: "java.lang". spl. package, we do not need to import this package.
->in java, we can even create our own custom / user defined exceptions
->we can display the name of the exception along with the default exception error message by printing the exception object

Exception Handling Syntax:
--------------------------------
try
{
	---
	error prone statements
	statements dependent on the error prone statements
	---	
}
catch(ExceptionClassName object)
{
	---
	take corrective action
	---
}
catch(ExceptionClassName object)
{
	---
	take corrective action
	---
}
catch(Exception ex)
{
	//optional block
	//generic catch block
	//can catch any exception
}
finally
{
	//optional block
	//this block gets executed when there is no exception in the try block
	//this block gets executed when there is an exception in the try block
	//usually, we write the closure code here
}
-----------------------------------


Rules:
->try and catch are keywords
->catch block cannot exist without try block.
->one catch block only represents an exception.
->one try block can have multiple catch blocks
->when exception is detected in th try block, the control is sent straight to it's corresponding catch block.
->catch block is not executed if exception is not detected in the try block.
